The First approach to solve this problem is by using @Primary annotation OR primary attribute in the bean tag inside
xml annotation driven configuration.

- By using primary attribute inside the bean tag or @Primary annotation in the case when the Dependent class is a User Defined class

<bean id="ldt1" class="java.time.LocalDateTime" factory-method="now" primary="true"/>
- The above line will get executed because it contains primary as an attribute which will tell the our ioc container that this beam should be injected
<bean id="ldt2" class="java.time.LocalDateTime factory-method="of">
<constructor-arg name="year" value="2002"/>
<constructor-arg name="month" value="2" />
<constructor-arg name="dayOfMonth" value="24" />
<constructor-arg name="hour" value="16" />
<constructor-arg name="minute" value="30" />
</bean>
